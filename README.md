⚽ Player Injuries & Team Performance Dashboard

Mathematics for AI – II • CRS: Artificial Intelligence

⸻

📌 Overview

This project examines how player injuries influence team performance in professional football. Using Python for data preprocessing and analysis, and Streamlit for deployment, the dashboard provides actionable insights for coaches, analysts, and technical directors.

The analysis explores how injuries affect:
	•	Match outcomes
	•	Goal difference
	•	Player performance before and after recovery
	•	Injury concentration across months and clubs
	•	Relationship between player age and recovery impact

The final dashboard is interactive, user-friendly, and designed to support data-driven decision-making for sports management.

🎯 Scenario Selected

Scenario 1 — Player Injuries & Team Performance Dashboard

FootLens Analytics has acquired a detailed dataset covering football player injuries and match performance metrics. As a Junior Sports Data Analyst, your role is to uncover how injuries affect:
	•	Team results
	•	Player performance trajectories
	•	Squad planning and rotation
	•	Training intensity and recovery management

This dashboard helps stakeholders visualize patterns, identify high-impact injuries, and optimize future strategies.

⭐ Key Features of the Dashboard

1. 📉 Team Performance Drop Index

Identifies clubs most affected during injury periods by comparing pre-injury vs missed-match goal differences.

2. 📈 Player Performance Timeline

Shows individual player ratings before and after injury across sequential matches.

3. 🔥 Injury Frequency Heatmap

Reveals monthly injury clusters across different clubs.

4. 🎯 Age vs Rating Change Scatter Plot

Analyzes whether age influences recovery and performance drops.

5. 🏆 Comeback Leaderboard

Ranks players by positive rating improvements after returning from injury.

6. 🎛️ Interactive Filters

Filter by team and player for focused analysis.
